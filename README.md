**Description**

The project implemented is a simple CFG that has an english grammar the nonterminals are as follows:


* S represents a Sentence.
* NP represents a Noun Phrase.
* VP represents a Verb Phrase.
* PP represents a Prepositional Phrase.
* Int represents an Interjection.
* D represents a Determiner.
* N represents a Noun.
* V represents a Verb.
* P represents a Preposition.
* Adj represents an Adjective.
* Adv represents an Adverb.
* C represents a Conjunction.

The terminal symbols include: ate, walked, run, jumped, dog, cat, man,telescope, park, rat, under, in, on, by, with, quick, big, lazy, and green

Some sentences that can be formed from this are:
Oh a cat walked quickly.


1. Well the dog saw a rat
2. So a big cat ate the rat
3. I saw a man in the park
4. The lazy dog walked slowly and the cat jumped quickly
5. I jumped
6. A big dog saw a lazy cat in the park
7. So a quick rat run
8. Well a man walked under a telescope
9. Oh the cat and the dog saw a rat
10. A cat walked

These are just a few applicable examples but many more sentences can be created using the CFG below.
